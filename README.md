# Sudoku_Solver_Python_basic
This project took a few hours.  I plan on adding the ability to upload either a picture of a puzzle OR a URL to an image of a puzzle and use that as the puzzle the algorithm solves.
I may also add a GUI which animates the whole process of backtracking.  

Important notes:
  Only main.py and Sudoku_Solver.py are relevant, and solve_board(self) used recursion but errors occurred so I went with the solve_board_while(self) which uses a while loop only.  Again, in the future I plan on making a full GUI version which animates stuff.
